# FlightDeals
This project will be useful to people who love traveling and exploring the world but do not have any preference on where they will like to go and have a limited budget. 
Using sheety api I used 3 columns (city, iatacode and lowest price) to store the information of 10 beautiful places to visit. I manually typed in the cities and the lowest price. I got the iatacode of each city using the tequila API more specifically the locations API, I used the response from tequila API and sheety API to fill the iatacode column in the spreadsheet
I used the iatacode for the departure and destination city, the parameters to search for the cheapest flights from tommorow to six months from now, and the minimum and maximum amount of nights to stay in a city and the lowest price as parameters to get a response from the search API in from tequila API.
Users can sign up with their name and email, their information is saved to a spreadshet using sheety API, if there is a flight that is less than or equal to the lowest price that you are willing to spend, you will receive an email of the flight details and a link to book the flight.
